title: Talking Pairing with Shopify's VP Eng
permalink: /shopify-interview
meta: Farhan Thawar (VP of Engineering at Shopify) and Ben Orenstein (CEO of Tuple) address common objections to pair programming, how to be a great pair, whether pairing obviates code review, introducing the practice to new teams, and how Shopify is continuing its pairing culture in a digital-first world.

In this video, I interview [Farhan Thawar](https://twitter.com/fnthawar), VP of Engineering and fervent pair programmer at Shopify.

This discussion goes deep into pairing. Even intermediate and advanced folks are likely to get quite a bit from it.

### Topics include

* His experience managing 125 pairs of developers.
* Things you learn from pairing that aren't just about code.
* How he defines pair programming.
* Why the more junior developer in a pair should usually drive.
* Pairing's marketing problem. 
* How pairing is like the underhanded free-throw in the NBA. 
* His response to the "isn't pairing is slower?" question.
* The downsides of pairing.

It's hard to find someone with more pairing experience (or even just engineering management experience) than Farhan, so he's a voice well worth listening to.
