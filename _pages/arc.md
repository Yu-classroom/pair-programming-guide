### Excerpts

> Think about pair programming as a tool in your tool belt. Don't think of it as a religion you need to adopt or a crazy practice that needs to be spread around your team. 

> Pairing has a marketing problems: people assume it's some mystical, difficult, weird practice. And they have to be into it or not. But it's just programmers working together on code! There are no special rules about who's typing, who's mousing, whose turn it is, how to switch. You can decide all of that for yourself depending on what works for you.

> I would say the biggest thing if you're pairing with someone less experienced is probably to realize that they're probably a little bit nervous.
